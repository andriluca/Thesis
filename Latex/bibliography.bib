                  distress syndrome (RDS) due to functional and
                  structural immaturity. A lack of surfactant promotes
                  collapse of alveolar regions and airways such that
                  newborns with RDS are subject to increased
                  inspiratory effort and non-homogeneous
                  ventilation. Pressure oscillation has been
                  incorporated into one form of RDS treatment;
                  however, how far it reaches various parts of the
                  lung is still questionable. Since in-vivo
                  measurement is very difficult if not impossible,
                  mathematical modeling may be used as one way of
                  assessment. Whereas many models of the respiratory
                  system have been developed for adults, the neonatal
                  lung remains essentially ill-described in
                  mathematical models. A mathematical model is
                  developed, which represents the first few
                  generations of the tracheo-bronchial tree and the 5
                  lobes that make up the premature ovine lung. The
                  elements of the model are derived using the lumped
                  parameter approach and formulated in Simulink™
                  within the Matlab™ environment. The respiratory
                  parameters at the airway opening compare well with
                  those measured from experiments. The model
                  demonstrates the ability to predict pressures, flows
                  and volumes in the alveolar regions of a premature
                  ovine lung.",

                  inter-subject differences in airway geometry. The
                  application of computational models in understanding
                  the significance of these differences has previously
                  been shown to be a useful tool in biomedical
                  research. Studies using image-based geometries alone
                  are limited to the analysis of the central airways,
                  down to generation 6-10, as other airways are not
                  visible on high-resolution CT. However, airways
                  distal to this, often termed the small airways, are
                  known to play a crucial role in common airway
                  diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive
                  pulmonary disease (COPD). Other studies have
                  incorporated an algorithmic approach to extrapolate
                  CT segmented airways in order to obtain a complete
                  conducting airway tree down to the level of the
                  acinus. These models have typically been used for
                  mechanistic studies, but also have the potential to
                  be used in a patient-specific setting. In the
                  current study, an image analysis and modelling
                  pipeline was developed and applied to a number of
                  healthy (n = 11) and asthmatic (n = 24) CT patient
                  scans to produce complete patient-based airway
                  models to the acinar level (mean terminal generation
                  15.8 $\pm$ 0.47). The resulting models are analysed
                  in terms of morphometric properties and seen to be
                  consistent with previous work. A number of global
                  clinical lung function measures are compared to
                  resistance predictions in the models to assess their
                  suitability for use in a patient-specific setting.
                  We show a significant difference (p < 0.01) in
                  airways resistance at all tested flow rates in
                  complete airway trees built using CT data from
                  severe asthmatics (GINA 3-5) versus healthy
                  subjects. Further, model predictions of airways
                  resistance at all flow rates are shown to correlate
                  with patient forced expiratory volume in one second
                  (FEV1) (Spearman $\rho$ = -0.65, p < 0.001) and, at
                  low flow rates (0.00017 L/s), FEV1 over forced vital
                  capacity (FEV1/FVC) ($\rho$ = -0.58, p < 0.001). We
                  conclude that the pipeline and anatomical models can
                  be used directly in mechanistic modelling studies
                  and can form the basis for future patient-based
                  modelling studies.",

  abstract  = "Regional ventilation in the injured lung is
                  heterogeneous and frequency dependent, making it
                  difficult to predict how an oscillatory flow
                  waveform at a specified frequency will be
                  distributed throughout the periphery. To predict the
                  impact of mechanical heterogeneity on regional
                  ventilation distribution and gas transport, we
                  developed a computational model of distributed gas
                  flow and CO2 elimination during oscillatory
                  ventilation from 0.1 to 30 Hz. The model consists of
                  a three-dimensional airway network of a canine lung,
                  with heterogeneous parenchymal tissues to mimic
                  effects of gravity and injury. Model CO2 elimination
                  during single frequency oscillation was validated
                  against previously published experimental data
                  (Venegas JG, Hales CA, Strieder DJ, J Appl Physiol
                  60: 1025--1030, 1986). Simulations of gas transport
                  demonstrated a critical transition in flow
                  distribution at the resonant frequency, where the
                  reactive components of mechanical impedance due to
                  airway inertia and parenchymal elastance were
                  equal. For frequencies above resonance, the
                  distribution of ventilation became spatially
                  clustered and frequency dependent.  These results
                  highlight the importance of oscillatory frequency in
                  managing the regional distribution of ventilation
                  and gas exchange in the heterogeneous lung.",

                  predict function relations in the lung. These
                  models, however, are not anatomically explicit. We
                  have advanced a three-dimensional airway tree model
                  to relate dynamic lung function to alterations in
                  structure, particularly when constriction patterns
                  are imposed heterogeneously inspecific anatomic
                  locations. First we predicted the sensitivity of
                  dynamic lung resistance and elastance (RL and EL) to
                  explicit forms of potential constriction
                  patterns. Simulations show that severe and
                  heterogeneous peripheral airway constriction
                  confined to a single region in the lung (apex, mid,
                  or base) will not produce substantial alterations in
                  whole lung properties as measured from the airway
                  opening. Conversely, when measured RL and EL are
                  abnormal, it is likely that significant (but not
                  necessarily homogeneous) constriction has occurred
                  throughout the entire airway tree. We also introduce

  abstract  = "We propose that the respiratory transition at birth
                  passes through three distinct, but overlapping
                  phases, which reflect different physiological states
                  of the lung. Accordingly, respiratory support given
                  to infants should be optimised to suit the
                  underlying physiological state of the lung as it
                  passes through each phase. During the first phase,
                  the airways are liquid-filled and so no pulmonary
                  gas exchange can occur.  Respiratory support should,
                  therefore, be focused on clearing the gas exchange
                  regions of liquid. In the absence of gas exchange,
                  little or no CO2will accumulate within the airways
                  and, therefore, interrupting inflation pressures to
                  allow the lung to deflate and exhale CO2is
                  unnecessary. This is the primary rationale for
                  administering a sustained inflation at birth. During
                  the second phase, the gas exchange regions are
                  mostly cleared of liquid, allowing pulmonary gas
                  exchange to commence. However, the liquid cleared
                  from the airways resides within the tissue during
                  this phase, which increases perialveolar
                  interstitial tissue pressures and the risk of liquid
                  re-entry back into the airways. As a result,
                  respiratory support should be optimised to minimise
                  alveolar re-flooding during expiration, which can be
                  achieved by applying an end-expiratory pressure. The
                  third and final phase occurs when the liquid is
                  eventually cleared from lung tissue. Although gas
                  exchange may be restricted by lung immaturity,
                  injury and inflammation during this phase,
                  considerations of how fetal lung liquid can
                  adversely affect lung function are no longer
                  relevant.",

                  changes in lung mechanics during the first inflation
                  at birth and their relationship to changes in lung
                  volume. Intubated preterm lambs (gestational age,
                  124-127 days; n = 17) were studied at birth. Lung
                  volume changes were measured by electrical impedance
                  tomography (VLEIT). Respiratory system resistance
                  (R5) and oscillatory compliance (Cx5) were monitored
                  with the forced oscillation technique at 5 Hz. Lambs
                  received 3-7 s of 8 cmH2O of continuous distending
                  pressure (CDP) before delivery of a sustained
                  inflation (SI) of 40 cmH2O. The SI was then applied
                  until either Cx5 or the VLEIT or the airway opening
                  volume was stable. CDP was resumed for 3-7 s before
                  commencement of mechanical ventilation. The
                  exponential increases with time of Cx5 and VLEIT
                  from commencement of the SI were characterized by
                  estimating their time constants ($\tau$Cx5 and
                  $\tau$VLEIT, respectively). During SI, a fast
                  decrease in R5 and an exponential increase in Cx5
                  and VLEIT were observed. Cx5 and VLEIT provided
                  comparable information on the dynamics of lung
                  aeration in all lambs, with $\tau$Cx5 and
                  $\tau$VLEIT being highly linearly correlated (r2 =
                  0.87, P < 0.001). Cx5 and VLEIT decreased
                  immediately after SI. Despite the standardization of
                  the animal model, changes in Cx5 and R5 both during
                  and after SI were highly variable. Lung aeration at
                  birth is characterized by a fast reduction in
                  resistance and a slower increase in oscillatory
                  compliance, the latter being a direct reflection of
                  the amount of lung aeration.",

  abstract = {Rationale: The preterm lung is susceptible to injury
                  during transition to air breathing at birth. It
                  remains unclear whether rapid or gradual lung
                  aeration at birth causes less lung
                  injury.Objectives: To examine the effect of gradual
                  and rapid aeration at birth on: 1) the
                  spatiotemporal volume conditions of the lung; and 2)
                  resultant regional lung injury.Methods: Preterm
                  lambs (125 ± 1 d gestation) were randomized at birth
                  to receive: 1) tidal ventilation without an
                  intentional recruitment (no–recruitment maneuver
                  [No-RM]; n = 19); 2) sustained inflation (SI) until
                  full aeration (n = 26); or 3) tidal ventilation with
                  an initial escalating/de-escalating (dynamic)
                  positive end-expiratory pressure (DynPEEP;
                  n = 26). Ventilation thereafter continued for 90
                  minutes at standardized settings, including PEEP of
                  8 cm H2O. Lung mechanics and regional aeration and
                  ventilation (electrical impedance tomography) were
                  measured throughout and correlated with histological
                  and gene markers of early lung injury.Measurements
                  and Main Results: DynPEEP significantly improved
                  dynamic compliance (P < 0.0001). An SI, but not
                  DynPEEP or No-RM, resulted in preferential
                  nondependent lung aeration that became less uniform
                  with time (P = 0.0006). The nondependent lung was
                  preferential ventilated by 5 minutes in all groups,
                  with ventilation only becoming uniform with time in
                  the No-RM and DynPEEP groups. All strategies
                  generated similar nondependent lung injury
                  patterns. Only an SI caused greater upregulation of
                  dependent lung gene markers compared with
                  unventilated fetal controls (P < 0.05).Conclusions:
                  Rapidly aerating the preterm lung at birth creates
                  heterogeneous volume states, producing distinct
                  regional injury patterns that affect subsequent
                  tidal ventilation. Gradual aeration with tidal
                  ventilation and PEEP produced the least lung
                  injury.}

                  Hubmayr, Rolf",
  abstract = "The lung parenchyma comprises a large number of
                  thin-walled alveoli, forming an enormous surface
                  area, which serves to maintain proper gas
                  exchange. The alveoli are held open by the
                  transpulmonary pressure, or prestress, which is
                  balanced by tissues forces and alveolar surface film
                  forces. Gas exchange efficiency is thus inextricably
                  linked to three fundamental features of the lung:
                  parenchymal architecture, prestress, and the
                  mechanical properties of the parenchyma. The
                  prestress is a key determinant of lung deformability
                  that influences many phenomena including local
                  ventilation, regional blood flow, tissue stiffness,
                  smooth muscle contractility, and alveolar
                  stability. The main pathway for stress transmission
                  is through the extracellular matrix. Thus, the
                  mechanical properties of the matrix play a key role
                  both in lung function and biology. These mechanical
                  properties in turn are determined by the
                  constituents of the tissue, including elastin,
                  collagen, and proteoglycans. In addition, the
                  macroscopic mechanical properties are also
                  influenced by the surface tension and, to some
                  extent, the contractile state of the adherent
                  cells. This chapter focuses on the biomechanical
                  properties of the main constituents of the
                  parenchyma in the presence of prestress and how
                  these properties define normal function or change in
                  disease. An integrated view of lung mechanics is
                  presented and the utility of parenchymal mechanics
                  at the bedside as well as its possible future role
                  in lung physiology and medicine are discussed.",

                  is an open source C++ library for the computational
                  simulation of mathematical models developed for
                  physiology and biology. Code development has been
                  driven by two initial applications: cardiac
                  electrophysiology and cancer development. A large
                  number of cardiac electrophysiology studies have
                  been enabled and performed, including
                  high-performance computational investigations of
                  defibrillation on realistic human cardiac
                  geometries. New models for the initiation and growth
                  of tumours have been developed. In particular,
                  cell-based simulations have provided novel insight
                  into the role of stem cells in the colorectal
                  crypt. Chaste is constantly evolving and is now
                  being applied to a far wider range of problems. The
                  code provides modules for handling common scientific
                  computing components, such as meshes and solvers for
                  ordinary and partial differential equations
                  (ODEs/PDEs). Re-use of these components avoids the
                  need for researchers to ‘re-invent the wheel’ with
                  each new project, accelerating the rate of progress
                  in new applications. Chaste is developed using
                  industrially-derived techniques, in particular
                  test-driven development, to ensure code quality,
                  re-use and reliability. In this article we provide
                  examples that illustrate the types of problems
                  Chaste can be used to solve, which can be run on a
                  desktop computer. We highlight some scientific
                  studies that have used or are using Chaste, and the

                  dimensions for generation of a host-shape dependent
                  three-dimensional conducting airway model. Terminal
                  branches in the model are both length limited and
                  volume-supplied limited. A limit is imposed on the
                  maximum possible branch angle between a daughter and
                  parent branch. Comparison of the resulting model
                  with morphometric data shows that the algorithm
