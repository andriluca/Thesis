#+title: My Master Thesis
#+author: Luca Andriotto

This is my master thesis repository, gathering Latex and model-related
source files.

* Information about the project
It is a morphometric model, embedding both geometrical and
physical/mechanical properties, of human lungs.

* Repo's structure
- [[file:src][src/]] :: contains all the source files used to process data ([[file:src/input][src/input]]), tests ([[file:src/test][src/test]]), components library ([[file:src/lib][src/lib]]), graphical results of the simulation ([[file:src/output][src/output]]).
- [[file:diary.org][diary.org]] :: journal I keep to track verbose logs of my work.
- [[file:Latex][Latex]] :: contains all the latex-related source files of my thesis.
- [[file:modelloMorfometrico][modelloMorfometrico]] :: past works on the same model.

* Install
** System requirements
In order for your system to properly run the simulation there are few
requirements:
- [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]] :: version control system.
- [[https://julialang.org/][Julia]] :: REPL (i.e. Read, Eval, Print, Loop) to run code in.

This software can be tested on any OS.

** Setup
Once requirements are properly installed, open a new terminal window
and type:

#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://www.github.com/andriluca/Thesis.git Thesis
  cd Thesis
#+end_src

*Change variable `repodir`* in file ~src/main.jl~ to match the
location of your cloned repository.

You are ready to run the code from terminal like this:

#+begin_src bash
  julia -t auto -q src/main.jl
#+end_src

or interactively in Julia REPL.
